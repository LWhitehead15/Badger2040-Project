# BADGER-2040 Badge files
- This is where all files used on my device will be found.
- I built upon the provided template files as I have much to learn.

# Accessories
- Initially, I had a yellow FDM 3D printed case I secured using 4x 18mm M2 screws.
- I then upgraded to a grey resin 3D printed case that looks cleaner and is more casual.
Also secured with 4x 18mm M2 screws.
- Most the time, the badge is attached to my bag or belt using a carabiner that loops through the top hole of the badge. However,
this is seamlessly swapped out for my LGBT University Of Lincoln lanyard.
- Credit to Andreas KÃ¤nner for the case design and printable files.

- As the badge is E-INK, I usually keep weight to a minimum by plugging in a portable charger to change the badges display when necessary. I do
have a 3mm sticky velcro set that I use to allow a 2x AA battery holder to be mounted and used as a power source.

# Functions
- As it currently stands, I use it as a personal badge for information of my profile (this includes University name, name, course name and website).
It also has a set of states that allow more profiles to be loaded on. Such as a profile for conventions that is more informal. There is also a store of
images that can be cycled through no matter what current state the badge is set to.
- Active power is not needed to display content, which makes it incredibly valuable for long trips or smaller form factor. Downside is that colour
is not available unless a more expensive E-INK display is used. It is currently black and white only.
